# VDay
Did you forget to do something special for your significant other on Valentine's Day? This is for you!

Add the VDay.cpp file to a project and link to winmm.lib in your project's additional dependencies configuration to add the music.

You need to have two songs somewhere on the computer that the program will be opened on, and change the absolute path names to the locations of those two songs. It's probably best to put a romantic song for the second path. First one can be anything that fits the badass theme.
